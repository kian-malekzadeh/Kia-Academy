# Learner dashboard

The learner panel is the authenticated home for Kia Academy students.

## Overview (`/dashboard`)

After a learner owns a roadmap, `/dashboard` shows a single-page redesign with nine live cards:

1. **Wallet & transactions** — digital card balance (IRR stored, تومان shown) + recent ledger/payment rows
2. **Bootcamps & challenges** — rank/points and challenge status with countdown
3. **Overall progress** — doughnut %, course/exam/certificate counts, activity feed
4. **Latest exam results** — readiness history + module skill bars
5. **Daily todos** — create / toggle / delete (server `LearnerTodo` API)
6. **Courses & paths** — enrolled courses with progress
7. **Support tickets** — list + in-panel create modal (category + subject + body)
8. **Admin messages** — latest inbox preview
9. **Profile** — inline edit, bio, avatar upload

Empty / loading / error (+ retry) states are handled per card. Toast feedback covers ticket create and profile save.

Learners without a roadmap still see the assessment CTA empty state.
